description: "Produce a conflict-free daily plan for the owner by locking fixed commitments (sleep, prayer, class), allocating the Daily Core (Math 2h, ML 2h, College Task 2h, Exercise 1h), slotting project work (VISWA/CERIA rotation), enforcing the Rp20.000 food budget, and persisting the result to Obsidian under Daily/YYYY/YYYY-MM-DD.md. Activates when the user asks for a daily plan, today's todos, morning plan, or \"buat todolist hari ini\". Audit-first: never writes a plan without auditing college schedule, prayer times, existing tasks, deadlines, and prior completion."

# todolife-daily-planner

Generates one daily plan per invocation. The plan must be:

- conflict-free (no overlap between fixed and flexible);
- realistic (total hours ≤ 24h, with sleep protected);
- prioritized (FIXED > CORE > PROJECT > MAINTENANCE > OPTIONAL);
- persisted (writes to Obsidian at `Daily/YYYY/YYYY-MM-DD.md`).

## Operating procedure

### 1. AUDIT (mandatory before any plan)

Run all of these in order. If any source is missing, mark `MISSING` and stop.

1. **Date / weekday** — `datetime_now` from xninetzy MCP.
2. **College schedule** — owner-supplied source for current semester (Ganjil 2026/2027 baseline). Reject class times that conflict with prayer or sleep.
3. **Prayer times** — derive from date + Asia/Jakarta; fixed windows of ±15min around each prayer. If owner provides override, use override.
4. **Sleep window** — 23:00 → 04:00 by default; protected block.
5. **Existing tasks** — `task_list` for unfinished items.
6. **Deadlines** — `goal_list` + `task_list` filtered by `due_at`.
7. **Math / ML roadmaps** — Obsidian notes tagged `math-roadmap`, `ml-roadmap`. If absent, mark `MISSING` and pick one topic from `Mathematical AI Research Roadmap` (linear algebra as default start).
8. **Project state** — `personal_project_list` for VISWA, CERIA, others.
9. **Vault conventions** — `obsidian_folder_status`, `obsidian_template_list`. If `Daily/YYYY/` folder missing, create via `obsidian_create_folder`.

Audit output is an internal representation; do not dump it to the user.

### 2. LOCK

Mark blocks with `LOCKED` flag:

- class blocks (from college schedule);
- prayer blocks (5 daily prayers + optional Dhuha);
- sleep (23:00–04:00);
- any explicit `fixed` task from `task_list`.

LOCKED blocks cannot move, shrink, or be overwritten. If a LOCKED block overlaps another, the second is rejected — re-source and retry.

### 3. ALLOCATE CORE

In strict order. Each block is 60–120 minutes, single focus, deep-work:

1. **Mathematics 2h** — follow current topic from math roadmap; default topic if missing = `Linear Algebra → Matrix multiplication`.
2. **ML 2h** — follow current topic from ml roadmap; default if missing = `Classical ML → Logistic regression derivation`.
3. **College Task / Learning 2h** — pick from unfinished academic tasks, ordered by deadline.
4. **Exercise 1h** — high energy: gym/strength; medium: cardio; low: walking/mobility.

Allocation must respect:

- No double-counting (a "ML + CERIA model research" block is one slot, not two).
- Energy-aware: heaviest cognitive work (math) gets the highest-energy slot.
- Travel buffer after class: minimum 15 minutes between class end and next task if location changes.

### 4. ALLOCATE PROJECT

From remaining flexible time, in this order:

1. Project with nearest deadline (escalate to P2).
2. Project rotation: today → `VISWA`, tomorrow → `CERIA`, next → ML research, then repeat. Owner can override via explicit statement.

Each project task decomposed to a **next concrete action** (e.g. `CERIA — inspect auth flow`), never abstract (`work on CERIA`).

### 5. ALLOCATE OPTIONAL

Reading / math game / exploration only if leftover ≥ 30 minutes and no CORE deficit. Reading priority: math book → ML book → research paper → academic book → general.

### 6. ALLOCATE MEALS + BUDGET

Three meals (breakfast, lunch, dinner). Estimated cost ≤ Rp20.000/day. If estimate > budget, surface `Food Budget Alert` and propose swaps; do not delete meals. Optional snack up to budget.

### 7. VALIDATE

Run the full checklist (section "Validation"). If any check fails:

- mark `OVERLOAD DETECTED`;
- protect P0/P1;
- move P2/P3 to backlog/next day;
- report deficit honestly. **Never fake completion.**

### 8. PERSIST

Write to `Daily/YYYY/YYYY-MM-DD.md` using the `todolife-daily-template` body. Frontmatter:

```yaml
---
type: daily-plan
date: YYYY-MM-DD
weekday: <Senin|Selasa|Rabu|Kamis|Jumat|Sabtu|Minggu>
semester: Ganjil 2026/2027
core_status: CORE_COMPLETE | CORE_PARTIAL | CORE_DEFICIT
food_spent_rp: <int>
food_budget_rp: 20000
tags: [daily, todolife]
---
```

Then add to `Task Capture` backlog only items that were moved.

### 9. END-OF-DAY REVIEW

If invoked with `mode: review`, compare planned vs actual by reading checkboxes in the daily note. Produce:

- per-core completion (X / 2h);
- per-project delta;
- food delta;
- sleep delta;
- unfinished items moved to next-day backlog via `task_capture`.

## Core quotas (defaults, override explicitly)

| Slot | Hours | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Math | 2 | roadmap topic |
| ML | 2 | roadmap topic |
| College Task | 2 | unfinished academic task |
| Exercise | 1 | energy-adaptive |
| Project | flexible | nearest-deadline + rotation |
| Optional | leftover | only if core satisfied |

## Priority hierarchy

- P0 LOCKED: class, prayer, sleep, fixed meeting
- P1 CORE: math, ML, college task, exercise
- P2 PROJECT: VISWA, CERIA, academic project, deadline task
- P3 MAINTENANCE: email, admin, cleanup
- P4 OPTIONAL: reading, math game, exploration

P0/P1 are non-negotiable. P2 may push P3/P4 but never P0/P1.

## Validation checklist (block finalize until all pass)

- [ ] No two blocks overlap
- [ ] All class times match source exactly
- [ ] All 5 prayers within ±15min of canonical time
- [ ] Sleep 23:00–04:00 untouched
- [ ] Math tracked as `Xh / 2h`
- [ ] ML tracked as `Xh / 2h`
- [ ] College Task tracked as `Xh / 2h`
- [ ] Exercise tracked as `Xh / 1h`
- [ ] Project slotted with concrete next action
- [ ] Food estimate ≤ Rp20.000
- [ ] Travel buffer after class
- [ ] Optional only if no CORE deficit
- [ ] No double-counted hours
- [ ] Total hours ≤ 24h

## Forbidden behaviors

- ❌ Skip the audit step
- ❌ Shift class time
- ❌ Use sleep as buffer
- ❌ Mark CORE COMPLETE when CORE PARTIAL
- ❌ Write abstract project todos
- ❌ Count `ML + CERIA model research` as both 2h ML and 2h project
- ❌ Delete meals to fit budget
- ❌ Starvation / extreme calorie-cut advice (weight 57→65kg is long-term goal only)

## Required tool calls

- `datetime_now`
- `task_list`, `goal_list`
- `personal_project_list`
- `obsidian_folder_status`, `obsidian_template_list`
- `obsidian_create_folder` (if `Daily/YYYY/` missing)
- `obsidian_daily` (read existing if present)
- `obsidian_create` or `obsidian_append` (write plan)
- `task_capture` (for moved/backlog items)
- `obsidian_save_note` (alternative write path)

## Related skills

- `personal-os` — wraps goals / projects / open loops / weekly review
- `memory-management` — persists the daily completion as episodic memory
- `xninetzy-obsidian-orchestra` — structural mutations; do not invoke for daily plans (read-only)
- `obsidian-knowledge` — read/write semantic knowledge
